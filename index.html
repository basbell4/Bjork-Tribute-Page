                    <p>Björk Guðmundsdóttir, known as Björk, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer, DJ, and actress. Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single "Birthday" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as <strong>Debut (1993)</strong>, <strong>Post (1995)</strong>, and <strong>Homogenic (1997)</strong>, while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects.</p>
